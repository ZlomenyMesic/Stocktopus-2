# Stocktopus-2
Stocktopus 2 chess engine

Still in development but already wins most games against Stocktopus 1.

Some stuff yet to come:\n
-better transposition table hashing\n
-pre-sorting minimax options\n
-gradual evaluation base on the current game state\n
-better evaluation\n
-unsure: deeper search for the best moves\n
