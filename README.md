# Stocktopus-2
Stocktopus 2 chess engine

Still in development but already wins most games against Stocktopus 1.

Some stuff yet to come:   
-better transposition table hashing   
-pre-sorting minimax options   
-gradual evaluation based on the current game state   
-better positional evaluation   
-unsure: deeper search for good moves
